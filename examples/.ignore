# This is an example ignore file

# This matches only a.txt under level1 directory (relative to .ignore)
level1/a.txt

# This recursively matches: c.text
**/c.txt

# This recursively matches files ending in: file
**/*file

# This matches only against the directory in which .ignore exists, negating from the recursive *file pattern above
!/rootedfile

# This allows any file recursivly named b with a three-character extension
!**/b.???
